# Ada-like-language-recursive-descent-compiler
An implementation of a syntax analyzer (SA) for an Ada-like language using a recursive descent parser. The analyzer’s sole function is to make sure a user’s source program is syntactically correct. The program also generates helpful recursive error massages in a stack trace like most modern compilers.
